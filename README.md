# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
Searching and Sorting Algorithms Practices
# Object References in Python

- All variables are references to object. When we assign a variable to another, both refer to the same object in memory.

# Searching Algorithms

- Find a specific element in a data structure

## **Linear Search**

**Enumerate: returns itterable of (index, element[i])**

Time Complexity: 0(n) - Linear time complexity in this case

Space Complexity: 0(1) - Constant space complexity in this case

## Binary Search

Essentially divide list in half and divide that half until the target it found

# Sorting

- Puts the data in order. can be ascending or descending

## Bubble Sort

- Repeatedly go on a lest and compare each pair of adjacent elements (meaning they’re side by side)
- Swap if the first element is greater than the second
- Repeat until no swaps are needed (list is sorted)

## Selection Sort

## Merge Sort

1. read the notes and watch the animation
2. without looking at notes, do merge sort and quick sort

## Quick Sort

read about list comprehension
